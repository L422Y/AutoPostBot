</details>

## Requirements

- Node.js (I use `ts-node` to run the bot, but you can compile it to JavaScript if you want)
- pnpm, yarn or npm
- OpenAI API key if you want to use the Wikipedia plugin
- Twitter API keys (with read and write access) if you want to use the TwitterAPIv2 plugin
- If you want to run the bot with puppeteered destinations: Xvfb/Chromium/Electron


### Notes for running with puppeteered destinations

#### macOS
>If you are using a puppeteer plugin, You will need to install chromium using `brew install chromium` and set the `PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH` environment variable to the path of the chromium executable, on an M1 Mac this will
be:
`PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin/chromium"`

#### Linux (headless w/ Xvfb) (tested on Ubuntu Desktop on OrangePi 5+)

>You will need to install chromium:
`sudo apt install chromium-browser` and set the `PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH` environment variable to the path of the chromium executable: `PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH="/usr/bin/chromium-browser"` 
>
> You will also need to install Xvfb:
>
>```bash
>sudo apt install xvfb
>``` 
>
>Run the bot using the following command (this is already done in the `start-electron` script in `package.json`):
>
>```bash
>xvfb-run electron -r ts-node/register main.ts
>```

## üìù Setup

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/l422y/AutoPostBot.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd AutoPostBot
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set up the environment variables


### üíæ Environment Variables


#### Global Settings
- `POST_MIN_DELAY_HOURS` and `POST_MAX_DELAY_HOURS`: Time delay in hours between posts.
- `ENABLED_DESTINATIONS`: Platforms where the posts will be published. For example, `TwitterAPIv2`.
- `ENABLED_GENERATORS`: Comma-separated list of content generators and their probabilities. For example, `FileBased:0.1,Wikipedia:0.9`.

```env
POST_MIN_DELAY_HOURS=0.5
POST_MAX_DELAY_HOURS=5
ENABLED_DESTINATIONS="TwitterAPIv2"
ENABLED_GENERATORS="FileBased:0.1,Wikipedia:0.9"
```

#### RSS Plugin
- `RSS_FEED_URL`: URL of the RSS feed to use with the content generator.

```env
RSS_FEED_URL=https://website.com/feed/
```

#### TwitterPuppeteer Plugin
- `TWITTER_USERNAME` and `TWITTER_PASSWORD`: Twitter login details.
- `PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH`: Path to the Chromium executable. On macOS, it's `/opt/homebrew/bin/chromium`, and on Linux, it's `/usr/bin/chromium-browser`.

```env
TWITTER_USERNAME=username
TWITTER_PASSWORD=pw
PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin/chromium"
#PUPPETEER_EXEC_PATH="/usr/bin/chromium-browser" // on linux
```

#### TwitterAPIv2 Plugin
- `TWITTER_APP_KEY`, `TWITTER_APP_SECRET`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: Twitter API keys and tokens for OAuth. These can be generated by creating a Twitter developer account and creating an app with read and write access.

```env
TWITTER_APP_KEY=__TWITTER_APP_KEY__
TWITTER_APP_SECRET=__TWITTER_APP_SECRET__
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=__TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN__
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=__TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET__
```

#### Wikipedia Plugin with OpenAI
- `WIKIPEDIA_LANG` and `WIKIPEDIA_CATEGORIES`: Wikipedia language and category preferences.
- `OPENAI_KEY`: API key for OpenAI.
- `OPENAI_INITIAL_PROMPT`: Initial prompt for generating posts via OpenAI, along with specific guidelines.


```env
WIKIPEDIA_LANG=en
WIKIPEDIA_CATEGORIES="Technology,Science,Philosophy,Mythology,Mathematics,Music,Computing,Engineering,Communication,Education,Weather,Energy,Materials,Chemistry,Physics,Biology,Earth,Space,Universe"
OPENAI_KEY=sk-eoirgheorihgoiwerhgoiehwrgoihwreoghj
OPENAI_INITIAL_PROMPT="Generate a 200 character Post like one of these:

`New electronic waste from discarded gadgets makes up for 70% of all toxic waste. Let's consider recycling and upcycling our tech to create a healthier environment for us all.`
`In the realm of technology, the first alarm clock could only ring at 4am! Created by Levi Hutchins in 1787, its sole purpose was to wake him for his pre-dawn job. Truly an early bird that transformed the way we start our days.`
`The first computer mouse was made of wood! Created by Douglas Engelbart in 1964, it was a simple wooden shell with two metal wheels. It was later patented in 1970.`

Do not make it a question, avoid using or featuring gender or politics, do not use phrases like `Did you know`. The simple Post should include a single interesting fact about the following:"

```


## üö¶ Running the Bot

Run the bot using the following command:

```bash
pnpm start
```
or, if using a puppeteer plugin:
```bash
pnpm start-electron
```


If you make updates to plugins, you will need to rebuild the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```
or watch the project for changes:
```bash
pnpm watch
```




## üîå Generator Plugins

Generator plugins are used to generate Posts. You can enable/disable generator plugins via the `ENABLED_GENERATORS`

### \> FileBased

Post from a list of predefined Posts. You can add new Posts by adding a new JSON file to the
`Posts` directory. The JSON file should contain an object of the following format:

```json
{
  "1": "This is a Post.",
  "2": "This is another Post."
}
```

The keys are used to reference the Posts in the bot's internal database. You can add as many Posts as you like to a
single JSON file, and you can add as many JSON files as you like to the `Posts` directory. The bot will pick a random
Post from the database and Post it. The bot will not Post the same Post twice, unless you delete
the `sent-Posts.txt` file in the root directory.

### \> Wikipedia

Post a random article from Wikipedia. You can control the language and categories of the articles via the environment.
OpenAI will be used to generate a Post based on the article's content.

### \> RSSFeed

Post a random article from an RSS feed. You can control the URL of the RSS feed via the environment.
Posted posts will be saved in the `sent-posts.txt` file in the root directory, so they will not be Posted again.

## üîå Destinations Plugins

Destination plugins are used to Post content to a destination. You can enable/disable destination plugins via the `ENABLED_DESTINATIONS` environment variable.

You can also control the chance of a destination plugin being used by adding a colon and a number after the plugin name. For example, `TwitterAPIv2:0.5` will enable the `TwitterAPIv2` plugin and give it a 50% chance of being used.

### \> TwitterAPIv2

Post content to Twitter using the Twitter API v2. You will need to set up a Twitter developer account and create an app to get the required keys.

### \> TwitterPuppeteer

Post content to Twitter using Puppeteer. This plugin will open a browser window and log in to Twitter using your username and password. It will then Post the content and close the browser window. This plugin is not recommended for use in production, as it is not very reliable and may be detected by Twitter as a bot. Use at your own risk.
